# Navigation

Ghost offers two types of navigation: **Primary Navigation** and **Secondary Navigation**. To add links to either of these two types of navigation follow these steps:

1. In the Ghost Admin go to `Settings`, click on `Navigation` and then click on `Customize`.

2. Either in the Primary navigation or in the Secondary navigation, click on the last empty field.

3. Enter a label for the menu item you are going to add.

4. Enter the destination link for the menu item in the URL field.

5. Save the changes.

You can also change the order of the menu items by dragging and dropping each one in the desired position.

The links of the primary navigation are displayed on the main navigation bar located at the top, as can be seen in the following screenshot:
